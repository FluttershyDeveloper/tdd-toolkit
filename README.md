tdd-toolkit
===========

Toolkit used in Test-Driven Development ebook tutorial: github.com/grzesiek-galezowski/tdd-ebook.

The idea of "Any" class is taken from guys at www.sustainabletdd.com

Note: this project does not aim to implement extensibility points, rather, it's an example to start working from when creating your own solution. If you need hardcore extensibility, go straight to https://github.com/AutoFixture and grab the generic tool that has possibilities far beyond generating anonymous data.
